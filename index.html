        <section class="content">
            <p>After nearly 30 years behind the camera, Giles Hudson, 51, is now the owner of one of Las Vegas’ biggest photography companies, <a href="http://www.imagelv.com"> Image Las Vegas</a>, while his wife Kim, 43, works as a freelance photographer under the name <a href="http://www.180360.com">180360</a>.
              </p>
            <p>The pair have travelled the world, had countless jobs, three children, and they've picked up a few stories along the way.
              </p>

            <p>So, if you’re looking to change photography from a hobby into a career or wondering what that could be like, listen up. </p>

            <h3>How did you first get into photography?</h3>

            <p>Giles: When I was 16 and living back home in England, I got a job at Boots in Cambridge on the photography counter, just selling cameras and learning how they worked. I didn’t know anything about photography, it was a total coincidence. </p>
            <p>A couple of years later, I went to Australia to work on a sheep farm and I took tons of pictures of the sheep and the place itself with the camera I'd bought at Boots, and I realised I liked photography.</p>
            <p>I came back knowing I loved taking the pictures so I needed to go to college because I wasn’t that great at it.
              From there, I did a two-year photography course at a college in Huntingdon and then I went to work on a cruise ship.</p>

            <p>Kim: I left my home in Fairbanks, Alaska to go to and study theatre in San Diego when I was 18. It wasn’t long until I dropped out. I wanted to stay in the Arts but I didn’t want to do theatre anymore.</p>
            <p>I’d been taking photos for fun on my own and I thought maybe that could be a better option.
              So I ended up moving to Vegas with my boyfriend at the time, mainly because we couldn’t afford Santa Barbara or California, and I started studying photography at the University of Nevada.</p>

          <section class="content">
            <h3>What were your first photography jobs?</h3>

            <p>Giles: I started working as a cruise ship photographer when I was 22. Hell’s Kitchen in New York was my first job. Bermuda and back, one night party cruises to nowhere.</p>
            <p>I was mostly photographing Americans so I had fun saying things like ‘Bollocks on the line, people’ when I was getting them to stand for a picture and they’d just say ‘Oh you have such a beautiful accent’.
              They didn’t have a clue what it meant, they just loved the accent. </p>
            <p>New Yorkers were also the bluntest people I’ve ever met in my life. You’d say ‘Squeeze together, let’s take a picture’ and sometimes they’d just tell you to eff off.
            <p>The cruise ships were great though because I got to see the world and take some amazing pictures. Eventually, I met my ex-wife who was a card dealer on one of the ships and we moved to Vegas together in 1993.

            <p>Kim: I started doing school photography while I was studying. I used to go to hundreds of different schools in Vegas. I shot 300 kids’ photos a day for $6 an hour. I made no money. I had to haul 500 pounds of equipment in and out of every school.
              But I liked it and I was really good at it. It made me think maybe this is something I really want to do.
            <p>After that, I worked in a lab, printing photos for some of the casinos in Vegas – places like Caesar’s Palace, Mandalay Bay, Flamingo. I was good at that too and I liked being in control of how the final product looked.</p>
            <p>Then right before I finished my degree, I worked with Giles.</p>

            <h3>Is that how you met?</h3>

            <p>Kim: Yeah, I got a job at Giles’ company that he shared with his partner, Paul. I was 22 so I thought they were like 80-year-old Englishmen.
            <p>When I went for my interview, Paul interviewed me and Giles had hurt his back so he was laying on the floor for the entire interview.
              I thought who’s that weird guy literally laying down behind me the whole time.
            <p>After I got the job, Giles went to England so I didn’t meet him properly for a month. I just thought he was some weird employee on the floor. Then he got back, I got to know him and the rest is history.</p>
            <p>But that was where I learned how to do weddings. Over four years I think I shot about 4000 weddings. And when I had to quit because Giles’ business partner was a jerk, Giles got me a job with their competitors.
              He worked out my pay and everything. He told them ‘She’s our best photographer.’</p>
            <p>We got married in 2002, two years later.</p>

            <h3>What’s it like being a wedding photographer in Vegas?</h3>

            <p>Kim: You get people dressed up in all different things. We’ve had Star Trek characters, and people dressed as cats.</p>

            <p>Giles: We did a Mission Impossible wedding where the groom shot the best man, and all the music came on, and the bride pulled out a fake weapon.</p>
            <p>One other couple got married blind drunk. They could barely walk down the aisle, they were just clinging on to each other and kissing and wiping each other’s noses. At one point, he pulled away and his face was totally covered in lipstick.
            <p>I don’t think they even knew what was going on. It wasn’t attractive.</p>

            <p>Kim: There was also this Elvis impersonator we worked with a lot, Eddie Powers. He was always drunk and would just slur when he sang.</p>

            <p>Giles: Half the time he’d wet himself so he’d have this big wet patch.</p>

            <p>Kim: I think he was sweating.</p>

            <p>Giles: Either way, it was disgusting.</p>

            <h3>Who is the most interesting person you’ve photographed?</h3>

            <p>Giles: We did a magazine shoot and video interview with Donald Trump before he became President. I was flown out to Trump Tower in New York, where he was filming The Apprentice at the time, and we went up to his office on the 50th floor which overlooks Central Park.</p>
            <p>Right before the shoot, his make-up artist who he’s had for about 20 years, did his bright orange make up. You could see the white lines round his ears. It was bad. We called him an oompa loompa - not to his face, obviously.</p>
            <p>But that was the first time I’d done a magazine shoot and hardly said a word. He was in charge. He was like: ‘Right come over here, I’m going to stand here, Central Park in the background, take the picture.'</p>
            <p>'I’m going to sit at the desk, I’m going to shout at you, you’re going to take some pictures.’</p>
            <p>That was the front-page picture - he was pointing at me and screaming ‘You’re fired!’</p>

            <p>Kim: The irony was, when he got the photos back, he actually complained about how orange his face was.</p>
            <p>So, when I was editing I had to reduce the orange on his face and clone his hair in to make his comb-over look thicker. It was really tricky actually.</p>

            </div>

              <h3>Anyone else we’d know?</h3>

              <p>Giles: We’ve done loads of people - Tiger Woods, Stevie Wonder, Tom Jones, Tony Blair, Pamela Anderson.
                The most offensive person I’ve photographed was Mike Ditka, a former American footballer. When I introduced myself, he looked me straight in the face and just said ‘I don’t like British people’ and refused to cooperate with me the whole time.</p>
              <p>In terms of politics, we’ve done Bill and Hilary Clinton, George Bush Junior and Senior. When I first photographed presidents, I was slightly intimidated because I’d never been around people like that.
                The secret service has to give you a background check to make sure you’re not going to go nuts because you’re within four feet of them.</p>
              <p>George Bush Junior was the most interesting though. I think he’d had so much trouble in his tenure that, by the time we got to photograph him, he was worried whatever he said would be taken in the wrong way so we were banned from using photo or video during his speech.
                He didn’t want the option of someone filming him putting his foot in his mouth.</p>

              <p>Kim: He also pinched my bum while Giles was taking group photos of us...</p>

              <h3>What other jobs do you do?</h3>

              <p>Giles: At my current company, Image Las Vegas, we do corporate and special event photo and video. We go all over the continental United States.
              But I’ve also been to Canada, London, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, Hawaii, Maui, wherever we’re paid to go. There’s lots of travelling.</p>

              <p>Kim: He’s gone over half of the year.</p>

              <p>Giles: We do a lot of business conventions. This summer, we’ll be covering the Domino’s Pizza convention which will have around 10,000 people.
                They do tons of pizza making competitions, things like that, and we obviously get free pizza which is a bonus.
              <p>We also do a Martin Luther King event every year in Chicago where we photograph influential African Americans.</p>
              <p>We’ve worked with some of our clients for more than 20 years. We have a very loyal following.</p>

              <p>Kim: Since I’ve had kids, I do mostly freelance portrait work and a lot of travel and food photography. I often get random job requests on my website from places like Amazon, food delivery services, hotels.</p>
              <p>There was a picture of the front of our house on there that was bought by Getty Images, the stock photography company.
                I took it in our courtyard at twilight when we had a party and the house was decorated with lights.

              <p>Every now and then I get a payment in my bank account when somebody buys it.
                It’s like $100 dollars or more here and there, depending on the size. It’s great, I wish I could do that all the time.</p>

                <h3>How did you start a business?</h3>

                <p>Giles: When I first moved to the States, I started working for Cashman Photo, the biggest photography company in Vegas, doing weddings and learning new skills.</p>

                <p>Kim: Las Vegas is a new city compared to Los Angeles or New York or London so Cashman was the one main photography company.</p>

                <p>Giles: I got promoted a lot but eventually I realised I would never get above a certain point working for Cashman because he was the man with all the money and I was the one giving it to him.</p>
                <p>That’s when I met Paul, my ex-business partner and we started a photography company in 1996 called Hello Las Vegas!
                  I had a lot of contacts from Cashman Photo that got us started as they hadn’t really done the corporate and special events stuff as well as we could so clients started coming to us.</p>

                <p>Kim: It’s all about contacts - who you know and who likes you.</p>

                <p>Giles: Working with Paul was also a good learning experience because it was like getting married to a man. A business partnership is the same as a marriage.
                  When you’ve never done business with someone, you can’t imagine how bad it can get.</p>

                <p>It got messy and ended up being dealt with in court. We don’t speak anymore.</p>



                <h3>Do you think you’ll carry on with photography?</h3>

                <p>Giles: I still enjoy the job. It’s harder now I’m older because it’s quite physical.
                  You have to carry all the equipment, and at a convention you start work at seven in the morning and work until 10 or 11 at night, every day. You maybe have two hours off in the afternoon.</p>
                <p>I can still do it, it’s just not as easy as it used to be. I’d like to go freelance eventually.</p>

                <p>Kim: I really want to do travel photography, that’s my dream. Travel, culture, food, that kind of thing.
                  I do a lot of those photos in my own time on my website and Instagram but I can’t really pursue it properly with three kids at moment.</p>
                <p>I also coded Giles’ company website so hopefully I can help them out more with marketing and promoting the page.</p>
                <p>We’ll see what happens.</p>
